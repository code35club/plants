    <p>
      The most common way to water indoor plants is to pour water over the top of the soil and allow it to soak in. If you use
      this method, you should give the plant a good drink of water, and allow the water to run out the bottom of the pot.
      Once all of the water has drained, make sure to empty the plant tray or cache pot so that your plant isn’t sitting
      in water.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this method you’re less likely to overwater your plants, and it can also be easier to water a large collection of plants.
      But there are also a few cons to using this method of indoor plant watering. First, it can be difficult to ensure your
      plant is getting enough water, and that it’s being watered evenly. Since the top of the soil is wet you can’t tell
      how much is actually soaking into the rootball. Another con to watering from the top is that the top layer of soil
      stays wet longer, which can produce the perfect breading ground for soil gnats (one of the most common houseplant pests).

    <p>
      1. Water the plant well three or four days before repotting. Since repotting is a messy job, you might consider tackling
      the task outdoors. Just make sure the weather is warm enough -- in the 60s -- or the plant may go into shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Invert the pot and gently remove the plant by grasping the main stem. Give it a slight tug and it should slip out of the
      pot. If it doesn't, use a butter knife or other flat-bladed tool to loosen the sides of the pot and try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Add fresh potting soil to the bottom of the new pot, packing it well around the drainage hole. Then transfer the plant
      to the new pot. Adjust the amount of soil mix so that the plant is at the same level as it was in the old pot. Position
      the plant, add soil mix to fill, and water well.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. After a plant has been repotted or top-dressed, it may show signs of stress -- the most obvious sign is wilting. It's
      a good idea to keep the plant out of strong light for a week or so to give it a chance to rest and rebound.

    <h2 id="sunlight">Sunlight</h2>
    <p>
      To determine the intensity of the light on a given spot in your home, place an object there and check the shadow. The more
      intense the light, the more defined the shadow. Generally, a south exposure is the brightest. East and west windows
      can be bright, but usually not as bright as south windows. North windows generally are the dimmest. Light varies considerably
      by time of year. Light also varies by what's nearby. It can reflect off light-colored buildings or snow, or be blocked
      by trees, shades, and awnings. Light intensity drops dramatically as you move from the source. Plants near a window
      receive far more light than ones several feet away, even though the room may be flooded with light.
    </p>
    <p>
      High light is found in a greenhouse or by a window with a southern or southwestern exposure. This is intense light, as strong
      as can be found indoors. It is also called full sun. Medium light refers to direct exposure from an east or west window.
      Also receiving medium (or what's often called bright indirect) light are spots near a filtered southern or southwestern
      exposure (or some distance from a similar exposure that's unfiltered). Low light is found near north windows. The light
      several feet from an east or west window or far from a southern or southwestern exposure (in both cases, often called
      indirect light) also qualifies as low light. Low light is common in corners and bathrooms. It is not total darkness.
      Your plants will let you know when the light is not right. Insufficient light causes spindly stems, yellow foliage,
      and leaf drop. Too much light causes leaf burn or pale foliage.
